âœ… Task 3 Completed!
I analyzed traffic accident data to uncover patterns linked to road conditions, weather, and time of day. By visualizing accident hotspots and contributing factors, I gained valuable insights into the dynamics of road safety.
These findings can support the development of targeted strategies to reduce accidents and make our roads safer for everyone.
